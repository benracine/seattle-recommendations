# Seattle

## Day Trips

- **Woodinville** is just a half-hour drive to the northeast out of Seattle: the complimentary [Woodinville Whiskey](http://www.woodinvillewhiskeyco.com/contact-us/) tastings and tours, the [Chateau St. Michelle](http://www.ste-michelle.com/) tour, and [Mark Ryan](http://www.markryanwinery.com/) (has a ping-pong table) all run daily from noon-5... and there's a [meadery](http://www.skyriverbrewing.com/) on a hill that's only open Friday-Sunday. <small style="font-size: 10px;">There are probably [10 others](http://woodinvillewinecountry.com/maps/). [Black Raven brewing](http://www.blackravenbrewing.com/) makes great beer nearby.  If you __really__ care about wine, go out to SE Washington and hit the [Walla Walla](http://www.wallawallawine.com/#wineries) area. That would require 2-nights lodging to make it worth it though I expect.</small>

- **I-90 East**: 
Rent some snowshoes down in town at either [REI](http://www.rei.com/stores/seattle.html) or [Marmot Mountain Works in Bellevue](https://www.marmotmountain.com/), get brunch at [Twede's cafe](http://www.twedescafe.com/) (in North Bend, WA and so straight out of [Twin Peaks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5PcoMrwEa5o)), hit a [trail or two](http://www.wta.org/), and then reward yourself with some day-drinking at the oldest bar in Washington, [The Brick](http://www.bricksaloon.com/). The Brick's bar itself is over 100 years old, has a 23' running water spittoon, and a jail cell in the basement... so, a friggin' gem.

- Ride a [**ferry**](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/) to a nearby island: one of Vashon (most earthy), Bainbridge (closest), or Whidbey island. I like the [Harbor Pub](http://harbourpub.com/) on Bainbridge. [Bainbridge distillers](http://www.bainbridgedistillers.com/) has tours Mon-Sat noon-5pm.

- Hitting the San Juan Islands is a bigger deal. I wouldn't recommend going without staying 2 nights (maybe one if you're really hauling). I LOVE [Doe Bay](http://doebay.com/) as it is a gorgeous little retreat out on Orcas Island... clothing-optional hot tubs with gorgeous views is a thing there. Might need to make rezzies there a bit out in advance?


## Parks in the City
- [Seward](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/seward.htm) is a good place to get a walk in.
- [Discovery](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm) has some nice bluffs that look out on Puget Sound.
- [Golden Gardens](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?ID=243) is a good place to catch a sunset or build a fire.

Always refer to the [The Stranger](http://www.thestranger.com/) that is found in most bars for the latest event calendars, etc.

### Ballard
This is an old Norwegian fishing village that got annexed by the city. The [Tractor Tavern](http://www.tractortavern.com/) and the [Sunset](http://www.sunsettavern.com/) are key music venues in the neighborhood... both right on Ballard Avenue. The former is known for keeping an Americana thing at its center and the Sunset is more just good local rock. Further, I hear good things about the line dancing on Monday nights at the Tractor. Tons of places to warm up in this area. [Domanico Wine Cellars](http://www.domanicocellars.com/) is run by a super nice couple, Jason and Jill if you are in Ballard on a Friday or Saturday night. The [Sexton](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-sexton-seattle) is slick. There are a couple unique breweries in the area, including [all these](http://www.myballard.com/breweries/). I think Reuben's has the best beer, but that [the Populuxe](http://www.populuxebrewing.com/) and [NW Peaks](http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/) are started by very likeable entrepreneurs. I like the more punk/thrash [2 Bit](http://www.the2bitsaloon.com/) for keeping it real as this neighborhood gets more and more "polished". A good neighborhood for brunching or chilling if Capitol Hill / Downtown have worn ya' down. [Walrus and Carpenter](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter-seattle###query:Walrus%20And%20The%20Carpenter) might be the best seafood in town in a tiny place, call ahead or put your name in early. 

__Sites__
	The [Ballard Sunday Farmer's Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ballard-sunday-farmers-market-seattle) is the best one in town I think.

### Belltown
Kind of known as a meat-market neighborhood for suits, but, this totally is not fair... it's way more nuanced than that. 

It's the home of [The Crocodile](http://www.thecrocodile.com/calendar/) and they put a lot of energy into their calendar, if it doesn't have super unique ambiance. 

There are several good high-end cocktail places:
- [Radiator Whiskey](http://www.radiatorwhiskey.com/) 
- [Bathtub Gin](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bathtub-gin-and-co-seattle), a "speakeasy" downtown with good strong drinks.
- [Alibi Room](http://www.yelp.com/biz/alibi-room-seattle), bar tucked away in Pike Place near the gum wall.
- [Zig-Zag](http://zigzagseattle.com/). 

There are dozens in the area if none of these work... [The Clever Bottle](http://www.cleverbottle.com/), [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/), and [The Whiskey Bar](http://www.thewhiskybar.com/) are all worth checking out.

### Capitol Hill
The epicenter of nightlife probably. Home of the [Neumo's](http://neumos.com/) and [Chop Suey](http://chopsuey.com/calendar/) music venues. 


Grab a drink at [Oddfellows](http://oddfellowscafe.com/) and see if you can time it right such that you can bop into the [Century Ballroom](http://www.centuryballroom.com/home/) for [a dance lesson](http://www.centuryballroom.com/home/classes/class-schedule). 

[Montana](), 
[Liberty](), 
[Witness](), 
[Redwood](), 
[The Lookout](), 

- [Hi-Spot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-hi-spot-cafe-seattle###query:hi%20spot), all-time favorite... may want to consider calling ahead as it can be a 30 min wait.
- [Olivar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/olivar-seattle-2), mediterranean place on Cap Hill.
- [Sitka and Spruce](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sitka-and-spruce-seattle###query:sitka%20and%20spruce), best locally grown and sourced food... the whole [Melrose Market](http://melrosemarketseattle.com/) that it is in is a treat to visit. There's a local butcher, a cheese shop, a wine shop... that kind of stuff.
- [Kingfish Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-kingfish-cafe-seattle), real soul food.
Good brunch at [Cafe Presse](http://cafepresseseattle.com/home/). Even 
- [Row House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/row-house-cafe-seattle), cozy place in downtown.
- [Bottlehouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bottlehouse-seattle###query:bottle%20house), a happy little wine bar right next to the previously mentioned Hi-Spot cafe.

### Fremont
Has a: 
- troll statue
- a Lenin statue
- a [chocolate tour](https://www.theochocolate.com/factory-and-tours)
- and a [Whiskey tour](http://fremontmischief.com/tours-2/).

### Georgetown
My favorite neighborhood. I just don't live there because it's a ways from friends and other places I go. Well known for their [art walk](http://georgetownartattack.tumblr.com/) on second Saturdays.

Some bars I like include:
- The [9 lb Hammer](http://www.yelp.com/biz/9-lb-hammer-seattle), is a dirty but endearing dive bar. It feels like you went to Montana. Perhaps my favorite bar in town. 
- But, I hear the [Jules Mae](http://www.julesmaes.com/) is older. 
- The [Runway Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/runway-cafe-seattle) is also passable as a bar.
- Just past Georgetown, down in South Park is the endearing [Loretta's Northwesterner](http://www.lorettasnorthwesterner.com/).

I like the [Hangar Cafe](http://www.thehangarcafe.com/) for brunch. 

### West Seattle
Keeping the dream of the 90's alive. I like these peeps... they are the 40 somethings that never left after the grunge scene quieted down. Brunch at [Easy Street Records](http://www.yelp.com/biz/easy-street-records-and-caf%C3%A9-seattle-2) could bring that picture to life.

### Pioneer Square
- Home of the [First Thursday Art Walk](http://www.firstthursdayseattle.com/), [Delicatus](http://www.delicatusseattle.com/), and [The Underground Tour](https://www.undergroundtour.com/).

Portland/SE:











These are all kinda big... for the bigger touring acts: [Paramount, Moore, and Neptune](http://www.stgpresents.org/) and [Showbox](http://www.showboxpresents.com/).

There is a healthy electronic dance scene, but might rear its head in [http://www.fredwildliferefuge.com/])(http://www.fredwildliferefuge.com/)



### Coffee Shops
- [Cafe Presse Seattle](http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-presse-seattle-2###query:cafe%20presse)
- [Dutch Bike Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dutch-bike-co-seattle-2###query:dutch%20bike%20company), it really is a coffee shop, I swear.
- Also more than I could possibly list... but again, I recommend Capitol Hill and Ballard primarily.

- [Volunteer Park Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-cafe-and-marketplace-seattle###query:volunteer%20park%20cafe), go to the [SAAM](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/visit/visitSAAM.asp), walk around Volunteer park (climb the [water tower](http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-water-tower-seattle) for a view), visit [Bruce Lee's grave](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d615595-Reviews-Bruce_Lee_Grave_Site-Seattle_Washington.html) in the nearby cemetary, visit the [conservatory](http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-conservatory-seattle).
- [Portage Bay Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/portage-bay-caf%C3%A9-seattle-8), 3 locations, this one is downtown. I probably like the Ballard one the best.
- [Wild Mountain Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-mountain-cafe-seattle###query:wild%20mountain), over in Ballard but cute.

### Casual dining places
- [Oddfellows](http://www.yelp.com/biz/oddfellows-cafe-and-bar-seattle###query:Oddfellows%20Cafe%20%26%20Bar), nice cafe in a great space and near a lot of the Cap Hill action
- [Ba-bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle###query:babar%20seattle), Asian and Pacific Northwest fusion in Cap Hill.
- [Bitteroot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bitterroot-bbq-seattle###query:Bitterroot%20BBQ), southern BBQ in Ballard.

### Desserts
- [High 5 Pies](http://www.yelp.com/biz/high-5-pie-seattle-3)
- [Molly Moons Ice Cream](http://www.yelp.com/biz/molly-moons-ice-cream-seattle-2###query:mollie%20moons)

### Bars
- More than I could possibly list... but again, I recommend [Capitol Hill](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=capitol+hill+bars&find_loc=Seattle%2C+WA) and [Ballard](http://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=bars&find_loc=Ballard%2C+Seattle%2C+WA) primarily. Heads up, Capitol Hill is the alternative neighborhood.


## Greater WA

- The [Methow Valley](http://www.mvsta.com/) has great natural beauty... x-country skiing and getting a cabin is what I picture doing out there. It's a pretty far drive, like 5-6 hrs in winter. Leavenworth is a faux-German village that's much closer if you want to get out to the mountains w/o so much planning.

- Mount Rainier: 
    - I rx a little hike at [Sunrise](http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/sunrise.htm)
    - Then I like to drive east and chill near the top of the pass at Lake xxxxx.

- [Chelan](http://www.lakechelanwinevalley.com/), Hood River, The San Juans, the Coast, the Olympics, Port Townsend, Port Angeles, Bellingham, and Olympia are all interesting destinations.

## Portland
- [Portland](http://waxy.org/2011/09/geeks_guide_to_portland_2011/), my favorite guide to Portland that I've found.
