### Day trips
- Woodinville wineries ([Chateau St. Michelle](http://www.ste-michelle.com/), [Mark Ryan](http://www.markryanwinery.com/), and [A meadery](http://www.skyriverbrewing.com/))
- Ride a ferry to an Island: one of Vashon (most earthy), Bainbridge (most wealthy), or Whidbey island. I like the [Harbor Pub](http://harbourpub.com/) on Bainbridge and its the easiest trip of the three, but you couldn't go wrong with any of the restaurants on those islands.
- [Snoqualmie Falls](http://www.snoqualmiefalls.com/) and hit the [Snoqualmie Brewery](http://fallsbrew.com/) too?
- Mount Rainier 
    - I rx a little hike at [Sunrise](http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/sunrise.htm)
    - Then I like to drive east and chill near the top of the pass at Lake xxxxx
- The Coast, the Olympics, Port Townsend, Port Angeles, Bellingham, and Olympia are all interesting destinations

### Brunch spots
- [Hi-Spot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-hi-spot-cafe-seattle###query:hi%20spot), all-time favorite... may want to consider calling ahead as it can be a 30 min wait
