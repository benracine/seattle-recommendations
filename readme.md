### Sites and trips
- Farmers markets: the [Ballard Sunday Farmer's Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ballard-sunday-farmers-market-seattle) is the best for produce and the [Fremont Sunday Market](http://www.fremontmarket.com/) the best for arts and crafts.
- Woodinville wineries ([Chateau St. Michelle](http://www.ste-michelle.com/), [Mark Ryan](http://www.markryanwinery.com/), and [A meadery](http://www.skyriverbrewing.com/)).
- Ride a [ferry](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/) to an Island: one of Vashon (most earthy), Bainbridge (most wealthy), or Whidbey island. I like the [Harbor Pub](http://harbourpub.com/) on Bainbridge and its the easiest trip of the three, but you couldn't go wrong with any of the restaurants on those islands.
- [Snoqualmie Falls](http://www.snoqualmiefalls.com/) and hit the [Snoqualmie Brewery](http://fallsbrew.com/) too?
- Mount Rainier 
    - I rx a little hike at [Sunrise](http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/sunrise.htm)
    - Then I like to drive east and chill near the top of the pass at Lake xxxxx.
- [Chelan](http://www.lakechelanwinevalley.com/), Hood River, The San Juans, the Coast, the Olympics, Port Townsend, Port Angeles, Bellingham, and Olympia are all interesting destinations.
- [Portland](http://waxy.org/2011/09/geeks_guide_to_portland_2011/), my favorite guide to Portland that I've found.

### Brunch spots
- [Hi-Spot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-hi-spot-cafe-seattle###query:hi%20spot), all-time favorite... may want to consider calling ahead as it can be a 30 min wait.
- [Volunteer Park Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-cafe-and-marketplace-seattle###query:volunteer%20park%20cafe), go to the [SAAM](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/visit/visitSAAM.asp), walk around Volunteer park (climb the [water tower](http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-water-tower-seattle) for a view), visit [Bruce Lee's grave](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d615595-Reviews-Bruce_Lee_Grave_Site-Seattle_Washington.html) in the nearby cemetary, visit the [conservatory](http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-conservatory-seattle).
- [Portage Bay Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/portage-bay-caf%C3%A9-seattle-8), 3 locations, this one is downtown. I probably like the Ballard one the best.
- [Wild Mountain Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-mountain-cafe-seattle###query:wild%20mountain), over in Ballard but cute.

### Casual dining places
- [Oddfellows](http://www.yelp.com/biz/oddfellows-cafe-and-bar-seattle###query:Oddfellows%20Cafe%20%26%20Bar), nice cafe in a great space and near a lot of the Cap Hill action
- [Sexton](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-sexton-seattle###query:sexton), cozy southern style bar in Ballard with good food too.
- [Row House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/row-house-cafe-seattle), cozy place in downtown.
- [Ba-bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle###query:babar%20seattle), Asian and Pacific Northwest fusion in Cap Hill.
- [Bitteroot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bitterroot-bbq-seattle###query:Bitterroot%20BBQ), southern BBQ in Ballard.

### More $$$ dining places
- [Walrus and Carpenter](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter-seattle###query:Walrus%20And%20The%20Carpenter), the best seafood in town in a tiny place, call ahead or put your name in early. It got written up in the NY times which has made it tough to get in.
- [Sitka and Spruce](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sitka-and-spruce-seattle###query:sitka%20and%20spruce), best locally grown and sourced food... the whole [Melrose Market](http://melrosemarketseattle.com/) that it is in is a treat to visit. There's a local butcher, a cheese shop, a wine shop... that kind of stuff.
- [Olivar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/olivar-seattle-2), mediterranean place on Cap Hill.
- [Ocho](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ocho-seattle###query:ocho), tapas in Ballard.
- [Rays](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rays-caf%C3%A9-seattle-2###query:Rays%20Boathouse%20Cafe%20%26%20Catering), seafood with a view. Not the most character, but the view is to die for.
- [Kingfish Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-kingfish-cafe-seattle), real soul food.

### Bars
- [9 lb Hammer](http://www.yelp.com/biz/9-lb-hammer-seattle), dirty but endearing dive bar. Feels like you went to Montana.
- [Bottlehouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bottlehouse-seattle###query:bottle%20house), a happy little wine bar right next to the previously mentioned Hi-Spot cafe.
- [Jolly Roger Tap room](http://www.yelp.com/biz/jolly-roger-taproom-seattle), classic PNW brewery with a salty fisherman vibe.
- [Bathtub Gin](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bathtub-gin-and-co-seattle), a "speakeasy" downtown with good strong drinks.
- [Alibi Room](http://www.yelp.com/biz/alibi-room-seattle), bar tucked away in Pike Place near the gum wall.
- [Celtic Swell](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-celtic-swell-seattle), Irish Bar in West Seattle with kind of a view... probably much better options in West Seattle, but that's what I know.
- More than I could possibly list... but again, I recommend [Capitol Hill](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=capitol+hill+bars&find_loc=Seattle%2C+WA) and [Ballard](http://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=bars&find_loc=Ballard%2C+Seattle%2C+WA) primarily. Heads up, Capitol Hill is the alternative neighborhood.

- Also more than I could possibly list... but again, I recommend Capitol Hill and Ballard primarily.
